Routes are for communication purpose only. They are the api of your application.
Routes can be used by your own application for instance, when communicating
from (back-to-front end) or (front-to-back end). Routes can also be used by
applications to be able to get a certain request from typically a database,
without knowing any of the implementation of how the data was retrieved nor the
structure of the database

NOTE all paths actually called the following way data/desriedRoute

NOTE the optional next function on some routes is to be able to get back the
body from blog_db. Which are the documents stored in blog_db!

# Site M

**Site M** is the source code to my own new website.
This single-page web app runs on **nodeJS** and uses **ExpressJS** for the server side and **AngularJS** for the client side.

## Features
Site M includes the following:

*  **Home page** contains my biography and technology stack.

*  **Projects page** contains my most interesting projects, they are mostly android applications. Individual projects are displayed in **modals**.

*  **Courses page** contains my schedule of courses that I have taken since I started my undergraduate at the **University of Florida**. Uses **accordion collapsible** for a unique and clean UI experience.

* **Restful API** methodology is used to communicate with **Cloudant NoSQL database** that contains each projects specific content information.

## Design
Site M was inspired by the beauty in simplicity.
Below is Site M's home page:
